The SignServer administration command line interface (Admin CLI) is started
using bin/signserver (or bin/signserver.cmd).
                </p>
	      				  <p>
Every worker is identified by an ID and an optional name that can be used in all
the CLI commands.
                </p>
	      				  <p>
It is possible to do configuration of a worker while it's in production. All
configuration commands are cached until a reload command is issued and the
configuration becomes active.
                </p>
	      				  <p>
There is a special property file for the cli interface called signserver_cli.properties defining which nodes that exists in the cluster. The properties are:
                </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>hostname.masternode</b> = Should only contain one of the nodes, specified as the default master node. Used by operations dealing with the database and where not all nodes in the cluster needs to be contacted. It is possible to override this setting in the CLI by using the -host &lt;host name&gt; parameter.
                </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>hostname.allnodes</b> = Should contain all the nodes in the cluster, separated by a ';'. Mainly used by the commands getStatus, activateCryptoToken and deactivateCryptoToken.
                </p>
	      				  <p>
Its possible to customize the CLI with your own code. How to do this is described in the development section.

It is possible to get a <i>brief</i> summary or a <i>complete</i> listing for one worker or all configured workers. If all workers are displayed will also all the global configuration parameters be displayed.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>getconfig:</b>
Returns the current worker or global configuration depending on options.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
For worker configuration observe that this configuration might not have been activated yet, not until a <i>reload</i> command is issued.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>setproperty:</b>
Sets a custom property used by the worker or crypto token, see reference for the given Worker and CryptoToken for available properties.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>getproperty:</b>
List the value of a worker or global property.

	      				  <p>
<b>setproperties:</b>
Command used to batch a set of properties, both for the global and worker configuration.
It can be used to configure a Signer in a test environment, dump all the properties and upload it into production.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
It reads all the configuration properties form a property file and depending on the contents of the key it sets the given property. All properties will be set  according to the following defined rule set.

<b>Authorization Related</b>
</p>
	      				  <p>
These commands are used to configure the internal client certificate authorization when it is turned on. It controls which clients that is authorized to request a processable worker.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>addauthorizedclient:</b>
Adds a client certificate to a processable workers list of acceptable clients using this worker. Specify
certificate serial number in hex and the Issuer DN of the client certificate.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.
Alternatively a certificate file (PEM or DER format) can be specified,
from which the serial number and issuer DN is fetched.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
Usage:
                        </p>

                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>renewsigner:</b>
Sends a request for renewal of the specified worker to the specified renewal worker. If the authcode parameter is omitted the command prompts for the password.
See also the section about the <a href="complete.en.html#RenewalWorker">RenewalWorker</a>.

	      				  <p>
<b>resync:</b>
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
The 'resync' command is used after a SignServer had a complete database failure. When this happens  will the Global Configuration become in 'Off-line' mode and it's not possible for the nodes to communicate internally and the Global Configurations will not be in sync any more. After the database is up again can this command be sent to the node that have the most valid Global Configuration and write it to the database. After this will the Global Configuration be in 'On-line' mode again.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
<b>Archive Related</b>
</p>
	      				  <p>
This commands can be used for processable workers that have archiving turned on. They 
are used to find specific archived responses. It's up to the implementation of the 
worker if it supports archiving or not and it is up to the chosen Archiver if it 
archives the data in way that it can be queried using this commands. For Archivers 
other than the default "OldDatabaseArchiver" and Base64DatabaseArchiver querying 
might have to be done directly in a database, filesystem or by some custom 
application.

	      				  <p>
The Id depends on the worker, in case of the TSA is the TimeStampInfo serial number used.
The data is stored with the same file title as the archive id and with the file extension 
depending on the type of item, for instance ".request" or ".response".

The SignServer Database CLI uses Java Persistence API (JPA) to connect to the 
SignServer database. The CLI is configured by the dbcli.* properties in 
signserver_cli.properties.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
The CLI needs to have the JDBC driver of the selected database available on the 
classpath. This can be achieved by setting the OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH environment 
variable when calling the bin/signserver-db script or by putting the JAR under
lib/ext/jdbc/ and calling it jdbc.jar. The last method is required to be able 
to run the JUnit tests.

Usage: verifylog -all
       verifylog [-node NODENAME[:OFFSET] ...]

Verifies logs from all nodes starting at sequence number 0 or only from the specified nodes and optional sequence number offsets specified.
If the nodename is suffixed with a colon and an number then the verification for that node is started from that sequence number.
The JDBC connector of the database might have to be put on the classpath. See the example below.

Example: a) signserver-db audit verifylog -all
Example: b) signserver-db audit verifylog -node server1 -node server2:708
Example: c) OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar signserver-db audit verifylog -all
                        </pre>
	      				  <p>
The command can be run to verify the signature of every entry in the auditlog 
as well as checking the sequence number in order to make sure that it does not 
contain any gaps.
                        </p>
	      				  <p>
The keys used to verify the log are configured in conf/databaseprotection.properties.

        *** Archiving of the audit log ***
      </h5>
      				  <p>
As the Database CLI audit verifylog command checks for gabs in the sequence numbering entries from the audit log can not be archived/moved to other storage without special care.
However since the command now supports the option to specify from which sequence number to start the verification the following scheme for archiving is proposed:                            
                        </p>
	      				  <ol>
                            <li>
Run the command to verify the complete log audit log:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -all</pre>
Note down the last sequence number for each node. Ie:
<pre class="code">Last sequences: {server1=2, server2=7}</pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>
All entries from 0 up to the entry before the last can now be archived and removed from the database. In our example that would be entry 0 and 1 for node server1 and entries from 0 to 6 for node server2.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
The next time the log should be verified start the verification from the last sequence numbers:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -node server1:2 -node server2:7</pre>
Again note down the last sequence number for each node and all entries up to the sequence number before the last for each node can now be archived.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

It is important to not remove the row with the last sequence number for any node as if the application is restarted the sequence numbering would than start again from 0 for that node.

<b> File -&gt; Add Worker/Load Configuration?</b>: Opens the dialog to import a configuration or set-up a worker manually by specifying worker parameters. When selecting "Load from file" it is possible to load a configuration file. This is equivalent of the "setproperties" <a href="complete.en.html#Administration%20CLI">Admin CLI</a> command. Selecting "Add worker" enables setting up a worker from scratch by manually specifying a worker ID (the default selected will generate an ID dynamically), worker name, fully qualified class name for the implementation, and (optionally) a signer token implementation. Additional properties can be added using the table below. When the required parameters are given, the "Next" button will enable moving to the next step where additional manual editing of the resulting configuration can be made (the format is the same as the worker properties files). Clicking the "Apply" button from this stage will load the current configuration. The dialog can be dismissed in both states using the "Cancel" button.

The administrators can be added by explicitly entering the client certificate's
serial number in hexadecimal (leading zeroes and letter case is not significant)
and the issuer DN with space after each comma separating DN components.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.

The card prompts for the PIN but then doesn't ask for which certificate to login with.
Instead an error message with the text "Received fatal alert: bad_certificate" is displayed.
This error message indicates that the server did not accept the provided certificate (ie, the issuer was not in the server's truststore). However, in this case the error could be because no certificate was possible to read from the card.
This has been observed with some type of smart cards.

                                    <li>Now insert the card and press Connect again</li>

In SignServer operations are performed by workers. There can be many workers 
and each worker has its own configuration. Each worker is identified by an unique 
ID. A worker can also be configured with a name by setting the property NAME. 
After the configuration has been activated (by issuing reload with the worker ID) 
that name can also be used to address the worker.

      Making the SignServer highly-available

Here are some tips on configuration used to make the SignServer redundant. Usually is the SignServer set-up with three nodes (required minimum for MySQL cluster) where one node is a management node from were all deployment and administration is done and the other two services are service nodes processing the actual requests.

        <a name="HTTP access requires a load balancer"></a>
        HTTP access requires a load balancer
      </h4>
      				  <p>
HTTP based workers like the TSA can be clustered using a load balancer accessing a health check servlet returning the state of the SignServer. The basic settings of the health check servlet can be configured in the build configuration file but more advanced settings are done in 'src/web/healthcheck/WEB-INF/web.xml'. With the default settings will the servlet return the text 'ALLOK' when accessing the URL http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth. If something is wrong with the sign server will an error message be sent back instead.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
The health check servlet can also be used to monitor the SignServer by creating a script that monitors the URL periodically for error messages.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
Tip, heartbeat with ldirectord is a good solution for a load balancer and works well with the SignServer. KeepAlived is another open source solution.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
The Main WebService using the Java client API manages the HA parts itself and then isn't a load balancer necessary.

In SignServer there exists a health check service that can be used for health monitoring. It is also useful for cluster, as it can be checked by load balancers to determine if a node should be active in the cluster (healthy) or taken out of the cluster (unhealthy).
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
The servlet is located at the URL: http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth and configured in signserver_deploy.properties.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
The following configuration parameters may be set to configure authorization and what the service checks: 
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
<source>healthcheck.authorizedips</source> - A semicolon-delimited list of IP addresses authorized to access
the healthcheck servlet, if the list contains the keyword "ANY", any IP address is authorized access (defaults to <source>127.0.0.1</source>).
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
<source>healthcheck.minimumfreememory</source> - Number of megabytes of memory that must be free before removing     
the node out of the cluster (defaults to 1).
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
<source>healthcheck.checkdbstring</source> - The string that should be used to do 
a minimal check that the database is working. May differ between databases.
(defaults to <source>Select count(*) from signerconfigdata</source>, the property is not used when running without database).
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancefile</source> - The path to a file containing the maintenance state, this file is a
standard Java property file and should have a property (by default named <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>").
If this property has the value <source>true</source>, none of the standard health checks will be performed, and instead
the result will be a string of the form <source>MAINT: DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>.
If this property is not set (or an invalid file is given), the maintenance functionallity is disabled.
                    </p>
	      				  <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancepropertyname</source> - The property name to be used in the maintenance file. This will also
affect the error message returned when in maintenance mode (the part of the string after <source>MAINT: </source>
(defaults to <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>).
                    </p>

                            <p>
<b>No errors</b>
<br />
If all tests passed the HTTP result code is "200 OK" and page contains only the text "ALLOK".
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
<b>Down for maintenance</b>
<br />
If the down for maintenance file indicates that the server is down for maintenance an HTTP response code in 5xx range is returned with an error page containing "MAINT: " followed of the name of the maintenance property as configured. No further checks are performed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
<b>Database test</b>
<br />
A test is performed that SignServer is able to query the database. When running without database a check is made that the configured directory is initialized correctly and is not empty. If anything failed one or more error messages are included in an error page returned with the HTTP response code in the 5xx range.
                            </p>

<b>Memory test</b>
<br />
Checks the available free memory. If anything failed an error message is included in an error page returned with the HTTP response code in the 5xx range.

<b>Workers test</b>
<br />
Each (non-disabled) worker is checked for a number of things. If anything failed one or more error messages are included in an error page returned with the HTTP response code in the 5xx range.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

<b>Token offline:</b> Workers having a crypto token can be reported as offline</li>
                                <li>
<b>Worker status and errors: </b> Each worker implementation can put different requirements on when it is status is considered to be offline.</li>
                                <li>
<b>Signer certificate:</b> Signers requiring a certificate are checked that they have a certificate matching the configured key-pair and that the certificate is valid according the certificate validity time and the configured minimum remaining validity time.</li>
                                <li>
<b>TimeStampSigner certificate missing EKU:</b> If a TimeStampSigner certificate does not include the required EKU its status is set to offline.</li>
                                <li>
<b>TimeStampSigner certificate not included in certificate chain</b> If a TimeStampSigner certificate chain property does not include the signer certificate its status is set to offline.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
